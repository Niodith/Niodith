-  Hi, I’m @Niodith
-  I’m interested in game development and software engineering.
-  I'm currently working as a XR Software and Game Developer after some time in the automotive industry.
-  I love learning new game engines and new programming languages.
-  I’m currently able to code (from best to currently learning or not as interested in) C++, C#, Lua, Java/Groovy, GLSL/HLSL, Python and C.
-  I have fun designing my own game ideas and concepts.
